“Boston Celtics superstar Jayson Tatum is proving that securing your bag means lifting up your entire community. Fresh from securing the NBA’s largest contract in history, Tatum has reportedly set his sights on a $200 million bid to bring a WNBA franchise to St. Louis – a decision that could reshape the landscape of women’s professional basketball in the Midwest.”

"Gordon Hayward admits that Rudy Gobert has difficulty guarding the perimeter

“He always had problems guarding around the perimeter and that was something anytime we played like a quick guard that can also shoot it was going to be tough for us. We had really tough times against Boston when they had IT (Isiah Thomas). We had really tough times against Kemba, we had really tough times against Dame. Guards that if he came out too far they go right around him, and if he’s back at all they’re just shooting. Hayward made sure to reiterate that Gobert was still excellent overall on that end of the floor. So I think that would probably be his only critique as a defensive player is being able to guard the perimeter. Now I don’t think he’s bad at it, I think it’s just those are world class elite level players, that’s just what they did was coming off pick and rolls, shooting.”
